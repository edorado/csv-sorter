Excel Macro to sort CSV's

Here is the CSV sorter that I showed at hack day today. Below are the instructions for it.

Important Note Before Starting - Be sure to store the CSV Sorter and the CSV you have in the same folder before you start. If you haven't, close the CSV Sorter and any CSV's you have open, and move them to that folder and open them up again.

Instructions:

1. Copy and Paste CSV in Cell "A1" in the appropriate sheet
2. Press the appropriate command
 a. Press Option + Command + b for Bank of America
 b. Press Option + Command + s for Well Fargo
 c. Press Option + Command + v for Chase
3. Press "Save" to save the two CSV's
4. Repeat for any other CSV's

Another Important Note - If you have the same banks CSV in that folder it will be overridden, rename it after saving if you want to save it. Regardless always click save!

Let me know if you all run into problems with this file. 

PS - Also when it opens, enable macros.
